RUNPOD - L4

1: Created a virtual environment : python -m venv mcp_env
2: Activated the environment : source mcp_env/bin/activate
3: Checked the general OS information: uname -a
    It gave the output as : Linux 7b4aa1e82801 6.8.0-48-generic #48~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Mon Oct  7 11:24:13 UTC 2 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
4: Checked the distribution name : cat /etc/os-release
    It gave the output as :
        PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS"
        NAME="Ubuntu"
        VERSION_ID="22.04"
        VERSION="22.04.5 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"
        VERSION_CODENAME=jammy
        ID=ubuntu
        ID_LIKE=debian
5: Had to install git:
    If you’re on Fedora (or any closely-related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use dnf:
        $ sudo dnf install git-all
    If you’re on a Debian-based distribution, such as Ubuntu, try apt:
        $ sudo apt install git-all
    Since this is ubuntu I used `sudo apt install git-all`
    But it gave the error : sudo command not found
    Then i noticed the following:
        (mcp_env) root@7b4aa1e82801:/workspace# sudo apt install git-all
        I am inside a virtual environment (see root@7b4aa1e82801), and already logged in as root, so:
            I don't need sudo at all!!! (sudo is only needed to elevate privileges — but i'm already root.)
            I just have to directly run:
                    apt update
                    apt install git-all
            I ran `apt update` first because it refreshes my system’s list of available packages.
            Without running apt update, the package list may be outdated, and apt install might:
                > Fail with “Unable to locate package”
                > Install an older version of a package
                > Miss newer dependencies
            What `apt install git-all` does:
                It checks the current package list (updated by apt update) and installs the latest version of git-all along with any required dependencies.
Thus git got installed.
