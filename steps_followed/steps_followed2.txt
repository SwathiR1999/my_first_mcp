After creating steps_followed1.txt, I followed these steps to commit the changes and push to main branch:
1: git clone https://github.com/SwathiR1999/my_first_mcp.git
2: git status
3: git add steps_followed1.txt
4: git commit -m "created steps_followed1.txt to log the procedure".
   But this gave the following message:
        Author identity unknown
        *** Please tell me who you are.
        Run
          git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
          git config --global user.name "Your Name"
        to set your account's default identity.
        Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.
5: So I set email and password
6: Then again ran `git commit -m "created steps_followed1.txt to log the procedure"`. This time it worked.
7: `git push origin main` . This asked the following:
    Username for 'https://github.com': SwathiR1999
    Password for 'https://SwathiR1999@github.com': (Here i typed my github password)
    But the following error happened:
        remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.
    So I created a Personal Access Token (PAT) in github.
8: Now i again ran `git push origin main`.
   For username i gave SwathiR1999
   For password i gave the token number generated instead of the github password.
   And it worked!!
